        In <a href="https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/05/12/adaptive-thresholding-with-opencv-cv2-adaptivethreshold/">this</a>
        tutorial, Adrian Roseback used adaptive thresholding, which considers small neighbors of pixels and then finds an optimal threshold value T for each neighbor.
        The neighborhood must be large enough to cover sufficient background and foreground pixels, otherwise the value of T will be more or less irrelevant.
        If we supply a very large neighborhood, then our results will look very similar to global thresholding using the simple thresholding or Otsu’s methods.
        They computed  the mean grayscale pixel intensity value of each 21×21 sub-region in the image to compute our threshold value T.
        They set C=10.

        The blockSize determines the size of the neighbourhood area and C is a constant that is subtracted from the mean or weighted sum of the neighbourhood pixels.
        In <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html">this OpenCV tutorial</a>, they used a blockSize of 11 and a C value of 2.

    </p>
    
    <p>
        Geeks for Geeks used a larger blockSize of 199 and a C value of 5 in <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-thresholding-techniques-using-opencv-set-2-adaptive-thresholding/">this</a> tutorial.
        Yet, none of them used a blocksize greater than 1000.

        Even <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d1b/group__imgproc__misc.html#ga72b913f352e4a1b1b397736707afcde3">the documentation</a> for OpenCV’s adaptiveThreshold() function, by giving "3, 5, 7, and so on" as examples of valid blockSize values, seems to imply that the size of a pixel neighborhood should be small.
        According to the documentation, the C may be negative, but normally, in most implementations of the function found online, C is a positive integer.

        In this piece of document, we are going explore some real-world images where four-figures-large blockSizes and negative C values can be useful.
