# üß† openCVChArUco

`openCVChArUco` is an open-source Python project built with OpenCV that focuses on detecting and calibrating cameras using ChArUco markers ‚Äî a hybrid of ArUco and chessboard markers. The goal is to make it easy for others to learn about marker-based camera calibration, pose estimation, and 3D vision techniques using real-world tools.

This project is intended both for self-learning and to help others understand and experiment with OpenCV's ChArUco tools. Contributions are welcome!

## üì∏ Features

- Detect ChArUco boards using OpenCV's `cv2.aruco` module
- Calibrate cameras using ChArUco board detection
- Visualize marker corners and IDs on live video
- Compare behavior of ArUco and ChArUco boards
- Save and load camera calibration parameters for reuse

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV 4.8.1 (`opencv-contrib-python`)
- NumPy

Install with:

```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.8.1.78 numpy
```

## üöÄ Getting Started
Work on this section is in progress.
1. Create a folder called `calibration_images` which contains all the raw Nikon photos, with nef extension, of a 14*7 ChArUco board to be used used for camera calibration.
2. Run calibration
```bash
python calibrate.py --calibrate images
```
The above command tells the script to calibrate using the images in the `calibration_images` folder. Another possible argument for the calibrate can be:
```bash
python calibrate.py --calibrate colors
```
which tells the script to calibrate using the png images in the [Colors directory](https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/openCVChArUco/tree/main/Colors).
If the script runs successfully, you will see two folders:
1. `detectedMarkersDrawn` containing images with detected markers, corners and axes drawn
2. `undistorted_images` containing undistorted images

## üîß Configuration

Check [calibrate.py](https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/openCVChArUco/blob/main/calibrate.py) to modify:
- ChArUco board size (number of squares)
- Marker size vs square size 
- ArUco dictionary (`DICT_4X4_50`, `DICT_5X5_100`, etc.). For now it is hard-coded to `cv2.aruco.DICT_4X4_250`.
