# üß† openCVChArUco

`openCVChArUco` is an open-source Python project built with OpenCV that focuses on detecting and calibrating cameras using ChArUco markers ‚Äî a hybrid of ArUco and chessboard markers. The goal is to make it easy for others to learn about marker-based camera calibration, pose estimation, and 3D vision techniques using real-world tools.

This project is intended both for self-learning and to help others understand and experiment with OpenCV's ChArUco tools. Contributions are welcome!

## üì∏ Features

- Detect ChArUco boards using OpenCV's `cv2.aruco` module
- Calibrate cameras using ChArUco board detection
- Visualize marker corners and IDs on live video
- Compare behavior of ArUco and ChArUco boards
- Save and load camera calibration parameters for reuse

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV (`opencv-contrib-python`)
- NumPy

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python numpy
```

## üîß Configuration

Check `config.py` (or relevant settings section) to modify:
- ChArUco board size (number of squares)
- Marker size vs square size
- ArUco dictionary (`DICT_4X4_50`, `DICT_5X5_100`, etc.)
